## Effortlessly Manage Your Projects with a Customizable Shell Script

We can automate switching between different Python/NodeJS/any projects by creating shell scripts or aliases that set the working directory and any environment variables specific to each project.

Here's an example of how you can create a shell script to switch to a specific project directory

**ðŸš€ My folder structure**
- **bin:** This is where I keep my shell scripts to switch between projects
- **projects:** This is where I keep all my projects

```
$HOME
â””â”€â”€ projects - This is where I keep all my projects
    â”œâ”€â”€ learn
        â”œâ”€â”€ api
        â”œâ”€â”€ web
        â”œâ”€â”€ pm => PDF Make
    â”œâ”€â”€ sdev
        â”œâ”€â”€ api
        â”œâ”€â”€ web
        â”œâ”€â”€ gp
    â”œâ”€â”€ p1 (Project 1)
        â”œâ”€â”€ api
        â”œâ”€â”€ web
        â”œâ”€â”€ gp => Generate PDF
    â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ bin - This is where I keep my shell scripts to switch between projects
    â”œâ”€â”€ learnapi.sh
    â”œâ”€â”€ learnweb.sh
    â”œâ”€â”€ learnpm.sh
    â”œâ”€â”€ ...
    â”œâ”€â”€ sdevapi.sh
    â”œâ”€â”€ sdevweb.sh
    â”œâ”€â”€ sdevgp.sh
    â”œâ”€â”€ ...
    â”œâ”€â”€ p1api.sh
    â”œâ”€â”€ p1web.sh
    â”œâ”€â”€ p1pm.sh
    â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```

Here's how you can do it on Unix-like systems (such as Linux or macOS):
For example, if we want to switch to the `learnpm` project, we can create a shell script called `learnpm.sh` in the `bin` directory and add the following lines to it:

1. Create a new file called `learnpm.sh` in your home directory.
2. Open the file in your preferred text editor and add the following lines
    ```sh
    cd $HOME/projects/learn/pm
    clear
    source run
   ```
    NOTE: Replace `$HOME/projects/learn/pm` with the path to your project directory.
3. Save and close the file.
4. Make the file executable
    ```sh
    chmod +x learnpm.sh
    ```
5. Now, whenever you want to switch to your `learnpm` directory, you can simply run the following command:
    ```sh
    ~/learnpm.sh
    ```
    NOTE: Replace `~/learnpm.sh` with the path to your `learnpm.sh` file.
6. To make the script accessible from anywhere in the terminal, Add the directory containing the shell/bat script to your PATH environment variable by adding the following line to your shell startup file (such as ~/.bashrc for Bash or ~/.zshrc for Zsh):
    ```sh
    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
    ```
    NOTE: Replace `$HOME/bin` with the path to your `bin` directory.
